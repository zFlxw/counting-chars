# Counting Chars
Counting chars is a simple counting algorithm, that counts the amount a character is present in an input.

# Introduction / preamble
The idea to this program was more of a sudden brainstorm, that came to me while writing an English exam. I do not even know why the frick my brain just thinks about such nonsense stuff while writing an exam but yeah. Here you go.

# Why Rust?
Well yeah. Since this is a quite easy to solve program I want to implement this in Rust, since I started learning Rust a few weeks ago and this might be a cool program to code.

# Task List:
- [ ] Basic searching algorithm
- [ ] File Input
- [ ] Directory Input




And yes - the name is inspired by [OneRepublic - Counting Stars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hT_nvWreIhg)
